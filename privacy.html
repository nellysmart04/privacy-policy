    <p>Last Updated: May 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome to unlocker 2, a service designed to assist Pi Network users in managing their wallets. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app. By using unlocker 2, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information with your explicit consent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Passphrase</strong>: A unique code you provide to access your Pi Wallet, used solely for authentication.</li>

        <li><strong>Wallet Address</strong>: The destination address you specify for transferring your Pi, used to execute transactions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any other personal data unless required for legal compliance or with your additional consent.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your Pi Wallet with your consent to perform authorized actions.</li>
        <li>Unlock your locked Pi balance and move it to your available balance.</li>
        <li>Transfer your Pi to the wallet address you provide.</li>
        <li>Ensure the security and proper functioning of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your passphrase and wallet address are not stored long-term and are processed only during the transaction session.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement encryption and secure protocols to protect your passphrase and wallet address during transmission. However, no method is 100% secure, and you use the app at your own risk. We recommend safeguarding your passphrase and not sharing it with anyone.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your passphrase or wallet address with third parties except as required by law or to fulfill the app’s purpose (e.g., interacting with the Pi Network blockchain). Any third-party service providers we use are bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>

    <h2>6. User Consent and Control</h2>
    <p>By providing your passphrase and wallet address, you consent to their use as described. You may withdraw consent at any time by ceasing to use the app. To request data deletion or further assistance, contact us at okeyn5775@gmail.com .</p>
    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for users under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn of such collection, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify you of significant changes via the app or email. Your continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
